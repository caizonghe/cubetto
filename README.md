## How to Update Cubettoâ€™s Firmware

### Prerequisites

Hardware:

- [Cubetto](https://www.primotoys.com)
- Micro-B USB cable

Software:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

### Steps

#### 1. Download the modified Cubetto source code

Download and unzip the modified Cubetto source code:

https://github.com/chosww/cubetto/releases/download/audio-feedback-0.1/Cubetto.zip

#### 2. Open the Arduino IDE

Open the Arduino IDE.

#### 3. Add the Cubetto library files

In Arduino IDE, add the `AccelStepper.zip` and `CubettoLibrary.zip` libraries from the downloaded source code: For each of the two libraries, open the Sketch menu, then the "Include Library" sub-menu, click "Add .ZIP Library...", and select the library file from the downloaded source code.

#### 6. Select "Arduino/Genuino Zero" in the Arduino IDE

We need to tell the Arduino IDE that the Cubetto board is compatible with the Arduino Zero board: In Arduino IDE, open the Tools menu, then the Board sub-menu, and select "Arduino/Genuino Zero". If you have to specify a port, select Arduino/Genuino Zero (Native USB Port).

If "Arduino/Genuino Zero" is not available as an option, it can be installed using the "Boards Manager", available on the Board sub-menu.

#### 7. Select the port that the Cubetto is attached to

In the Arduino IDE, open the Tools menu, click Port, and select port that Arduino board is connected.

#### 8. Open modified the source code project

In the Arduino IDE, open the File menu, and click "Open...". Navigate to the downloaded and unzipped source code (from Step 1 above), and open the `PrimoCubettoOOBExample.ino` file in the PrimoCubettoOOBExample directory.

#### 9. Upload the new firmware to Cubetto

The firmware may be uploaded to Cubetto by clicking on the "Upload" button (a rightwards pointing arrow in the IDE toolbar), or by selecting "Upload" from the "Sketch" menu.
